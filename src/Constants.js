    description: "I created a scalable chatbot architecture using AWS services, including Bedrock, SageMaker, and S3. To enhance document retrieval, I implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Kendra and LanceDB. I also developed real-time Lambda functions to ensure low latency and set up API Gateway for RESTful API interaction.",

    description: "I authored and presented research findings on space-filling curves at various conferences, including JMM 2024. I constructed specific examples of algebraic space-filling curves in three-dimensional projective space, focusing on those with the smallest possible degree. Additionally, I developed new geometrical constructs in three-dimensional projective spaces using Macaulay2 and Python, employing the NumPy and SciPy libraries to perform advanced algebraic computations.",

    description: "I conducted extensive research on the latest developments and best practices in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, reviewing academic literature and attending conferences and seminars. I analyzed and tested simple machine learning models, conducting experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of various algorithms. Additionally, I analyzed and interpreted data using TensorFlow and Keras to identify patterns and trends in the results.",
